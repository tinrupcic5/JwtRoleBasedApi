# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System with JWT in Spring Boot :coffee:

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a Spring Boot application using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization. The system manages different user roles, such as **Admin**, **User**, etc., to restrict access to resources based on the roles assigned to users.

We use **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, and **JWT** for secure token generation and role validation. This setup ensures that only authorized users with the appropriate roles can access specific endpoints.

- Spring security ([Configuration Migrations](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.8/migration/servlet/config.html))
  

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Uses JWT to authenticate users securely.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Roles like Admin, User, and others are assigned to users, and access to resources is controlled based on these roles.
- **Secure Endpoints**: Specific API endpoints are protected and require valid JWTs for access.
- **Spring Security Integration**: Spring Security is used to handle the authentication and authorization processes.

## Technologies

- **Spring Boot 3.3.5**
- **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization
- **JWT** for creating and validating tokens
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **Spring Data JPA** (optional, for database integration)
